This is the repository of my [website](https://me.johncvn.ovh/). I used a responsive blog theme, [Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features a blog homepage, about page, contact page, and an example post page along with a working PHP contact form.
